create_resources.py

pip install -r requirements.txt  

The Jupyter notebook shows some examples of how to call these functions.  

The Powershell script contains some Azure CLI commands to create some resources needed for a Databricks ETL tutorial. This is one way of combining multiple commands into one file and then the file can be called from a Powershell terminal by running...  
./azure_cli_databricksETL
